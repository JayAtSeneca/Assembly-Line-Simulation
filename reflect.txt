The Utilities module is used to parse the string data from input files into tokens for all the objects. In the utilities module, there is one member variable �m_widthField� which is used to specify the length of the token extracted, the default set to 1  and it has one class variable called �m_delimiter� which is used to separate the tokens in the string. It has three member functions which are �setFieldWidth� used to set the width of the current object, �getFieldWidth� which is used to return the width of the object, �extractToken� which is used to extract a token from the string parameter.
The station object in the station module which is used to manage a single station on the assembly line. The station object has five instance variables which are id, name of item, description, next assigned serial number of an item and number of items. It also has two class variables, which are �m_widthField� and �id_generator�. It has 1 argument constructor and other member function and queries. 

In milestone 2 we had the Customer Order object in the customer order module which manages a single order on the assembly line. It has four instance variables which are customer name, product name, number of items and dynamically allocated array of pointers of Item object type. Also, one class variable for width of field and other member function such as default constructor, custom one argument constructor and other queries.

In  Milestone 3, we had the workstation module and the line manager module. In the workstation module, it has three globally accessible three double ended queue. The workstation object has two member variables the double ended queue for storing the orders, the pointer of workstation type which points to the next workstation of assembly line. Furthermore, there is another module called line manager which manages the assembly line of active station. The line manager object has three member variable the vector of workstation type which stores the collection of active workstation in assembly line, other one is the variable to store the total number of customer order object, the last one is the pointer of workstation type which points to the first active station in the assembly line.
